Fundamentals project 2020

This project will perform and explain simple linear regressions using Python on the powerproduction dataset. The aim is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed using the data set as a basis.

- Using a jupyter notebook to perform simple linear regression on the data set
- An explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy
